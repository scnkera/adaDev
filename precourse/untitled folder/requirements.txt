Snowman Gameplay
In Snowman:

The user is presented with a list of underscores "_". Each underscore represents one letter in a word.
The user guesses letters for the hidden word
For each correct guess, a letter will replace the corresponding underscore.
For every wrong guess we are going to remember the number of wrong guesses and print out more and more of a snowman drawing.
When the snowman is finished and the user is out of guesses, they lose the game.
